---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read and Understand
1. Read `gauntlet-03/prd-v1.md` for complete project context
2. Read `gauntlet-03/memory-bank.md` for current project status
3. Understand the specific feature requirement
4. Answer key questions:
   - What video editing problem does this solve?
   - Who is the user?
   - What's the end-to-end outcome?
   - Why is this important now?
   - What are the constraints?

### Step 2: Create Brief
**File:** `gauntlet-03/docs/pr-brief/pr-{number}-brief.md`

**Brief Structure:**
```markdown
# PR Brief: [Feature Name]

## Problem Statement
What video editing problem does this solve? Why is this important now?

## User Value
Who is the user and what outcome do they get? How does this improve their workflow?

## Success Criteria
How do we know this is successful? What measurable outcomes define completion?

## Constraints
What are the technical, time, or scope limitations?

## Edge Cases
What could go wrong? What edge cases need to be considered?

## Dependencies
What does this depend on? Are there blocking integrations?

## Acceptance Criteria
What must be true for this to be complete? What are the pass/fail gates?
```

### Step 3: Review and Finalize
**Self-review checklist:**

Brief:
- [ ] Problem statement is clear and specific
- [ ] User value is well-defined

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Vague problem statements → ✅ Specific video editing problems  
❌ Missing user context → ✅ Clear user personas and workflows  
❌ Unclear success criteria → ✅ Measurable, testable outcomes  
❌ Ignoring constraints → ✅ Realistic technical and scope limits  
❌ Skipping edge cases → ✅ "What if video file is corrupted?"  
❌ Missing dependencies → ✅ Clear blocking integrations  
❌ Weak acceptance criteria → ✅ Specific pass/fail gates
