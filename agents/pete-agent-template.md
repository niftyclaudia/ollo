- PRD: `gauntlet-03/docs/prds/pr-{number}-prd.md`
- TODO: `gauntlet-03/docs/todos/pr-{number}-todo.md`

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read and Understand
1. Find your PR in `gauntlet-03/docs/pr-brief/pr-briefs.md`
2. Read supporting docs (prd-v1.md, existing PRDs)
3. Answer key questions:
   - What video editing problem does this solve?
   - Who is the user?
   - What's the end-to-end outcome?
   - What files will be modified/created?
   - What are the technical constraints?
   - What could go wrong (risks)?

### Step 2: Create PRD
**File:** `gauntlet-03/docs/prds/pr-{number}-prd.md`

Use the template at `gauntlet-03/agents/prd-template.md` and reference requirements from `gauntlet-03/prd-v1.md`.

**Critical sections:**
1. **Summary** — Problem and outcome in 1-2 sentences
2. **Problem & Goals** — User problem, why now, 2-3 measurable goals
3. **Non-Goals** — What's excluded to avoid scope creep
4. **Success Metrics** — Use performance targets from prd-v1.md
5. **Users & Stories** — 3-5 user stories for video editing
6. **Experience Specification** — Entry points, flows, states, performance targets
7. **Functional Requirements** — MUST vs SHOULD with acceptance gates
8. **Data Model** — Reference examples from prd-v1.md
9. **Service Contracts** — Specify Tauri commands with parameters/returns/errors
10. **UI Components** — List all files to create/modify
11. **Test Plan** — Define BEFORE implementation with checkboxes
12. **Definition of Done** — Complete checklist
13. **Risks & Mitigations** — Identify 3-5 risks

**For every requirement, add an acceptance gate:**
```
[Gate] When user imports video file → metadata extracted in <2 seconds
[Gate] When user trims clip → preview updates in real-time
[Gate] When user exports → progress shown and file created successfully
```

### Step 3: Check YOLO Mode
**🛑 If YOLO: false**
1. Present completed PRD to user
2. Wait for review and feedback
3. Make requested changes
4. Only proceed after explicit approval

**If YOLO: true**
- Continue directly to Step 4

### Step 4: Create TODO
**File:** `gauntlet-03/docs/todos/pr-{number}-todo.md`

Use the template at `gauntlet-03/agents/todo-template.md`.

**Guidelines:**
- Each task < 30 min of work
- Tasks sequential (do A before B)
- Use checkboxes for tracking
- Group related tasks into sections
- Include acceptance criteria per task

**Typical sections:**
1. Setup (branch creation, read docs)
2. Data Model (video clip schemas, project state)
3. Service Layer (Tauri commands, FFmpeg integration)
4. UI Components (views, state management)
5. Integration (file system, video processing)
6. Testing (unit, UI, video processing)
7. Performance (verify targets from prd-v1.md)
8. Documentation (comments, README, PR description)

### Step 5: Review and Finalize
**Self-review checklist:**

PRD:
- [ ] All template sections filled
- [ ] Acceptance gates for every requirement
- [ ] Data model clearly specified
- [ ] Tauri service contracts documented
- [ ] Test plan comprehensive
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigations

TODO:
- [ ] Tasks small (< 30 min each)
- [ ] Tasks sequential
- [ ] Each task has acceptance criteria
- [ ] All PRD requirements covered
- [ ] Testing tasks included
- [ ] References gauntlet-03/prd-v1.md where appropriate

### Step 6: Handoff
**If YOLO: false** (PRD already reviewed):
1. Notify user TODO is complete
2. Provide file paths
3. Summarize TODO breakdown
4. Wait for final approval

**If YOLO: true** (first presentation):
1. Notify user PRD and TODO are ready
2. Provide file paths
3. Summarize key points
4. Wait for user approval

## Success Criteria

**PRD complete when:**
- ✅ All sections filled with relevant info
- ✅ Every requirement has acceptance gate
- ✅ Data model and service methods specified
- ✅ Test plan covers all scenarios
- ✅ Risks identified with mitigations

- ✅ Tasks small and sequential
- ✅ Each task has acceptance criteria
- ✅ Testing and documentation included
- ✅ User approved final deliverables

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Vague requirements → ✅ Specific metrics (see prd-v1.md)  
❌ Missing edge cases → ✅ "What if video file is corrupted?"  
❌ No acceptance criteria → ✅ Define pass/fail gates  
❌ Giant tasks → ✅ Break into 10+ small tasks  
❌ Ignoring video processing → ✅ Address FFmpeg requirements  
❌ Forgetting tests → ✅ Include Jest and integration tests  
❌ Ignoring YOLO → ✅ Check mode, follow correct workflow
