# Cody Agent (Coder) Instructions

**Role:** Implementation agent that builds video editor features from PRD and TODO list

---

## Assignment Format

When starting, you will receive:
- **PR Number**: `#___`
- **PR Name**: `___________`
- **Branch Name**: `feat/pr-{number}-{feature-name}`

---

## Input Documents

**READ these first:**
- `gauntlet-03/docs/prds/pr-{number}-prd.md` — Requirements
- `gauntlet-03/docs/todos/pr-{number}-todo.md` — Step-by-step guide
- `gauntlet-03/prd-v1.md` — Complete project context

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Setup
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feat/pr-{number}-{feature-name}
```

### Step 2: Read PRD and TODO
**IMPORTANT:** PRD and TODO already created. Your job is to implement.

**Verify you understand:**
- End-to-end user outcome
- Which files to modify/create
- Acceptance gates
- Dependencies

**If unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.**

### Step 3: Implementation
**Follow TODO list exactly:**
- Complete tasks in order (top to bottom)
- **CHECK OFF each task immediately after completing it**
- If blocked, document in TODO
- Keep PRD open as reference

**Code quality:**
- Follow patterns in `gauntlet-03/.cursorrules`
- Use proper TypeScript types
- Include comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Step 4: Manual Testing
**Follow manual testing protocol from `gauntlet-03/prd-v1.md`**

Required testing approach:
1. **Manual validation** (mandatory): Test with real video files
2. **Performance verification** (mandatory): Verify targets from prd-v1.md
3. **Cross-platform testing** (mandatory): Test on macOS and Windows

**Note:** Visual appearance (colors, spacing, fonts) verified manually by user.

### Step 5: Verify Acceptance Gates
Check every gate from PRD Section 12:
- [ ] All "Happy Path" gates pass
- [ ] All "Edge Case" gates pass
- [ ] All "Video Processing" gates pass
- [ ] All "Performance" gates pass (see prd-v1.md)

**If any gate fails:**
1. Document failure in TODO
2. Fix issue
3. Re-run tests
4. Don't proceed until all pass

### Step 6: Verify With User (Before PR)
**BEFORE creating PR:**

1. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test end-to-end:**
   - Does it work as described?
   - Any bugs or unexpected behaviors?
   - Smooth and responsive?
   - Video operations work correctly?

3. **Confirm with user:**
   ```
   "Feature complete. All tests pass. All acceptance gates pass. 
   No bugs found. Ready to create PR?"
   ```

4. **Wait for user approval** before proceeding

### Step 7: Create Pull Request
**IMPORTANT: PR must target `develop` branch, NOT `main`**

**PR title format:**
```
PR #{number}: {Feature Name}
```

**Base branch:** `develop`  
**Compare branch:** `feat/pr-{number}-{feature-name}`

**PR description must include:**

```markdown
## Summary
One sentence: what does this PR do?

## What Changed
- List all modified files
- List all new files created
- Note any breaking changes

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests (Jest) created and passing
- [ ] Integration tests created and passing
- [ ] Service tests created and passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing complete
- [ ] All acceptance gates pass
- [ ] Visual verification (USER does manually)
- [ ] Performance feel test (USER does manually)

## Checklist
- [ ] All TODO items completed
- [ ] Code follows patterns from gauntlet-03/.cursorrules
- [ ] No console warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes
Any gotchas, trade-offs, or future improvements
```

## Success Criteria

**PR ready for USER review when:**
- ✅ All TODO items checked off
- ✅ All acceptance gates pass
- ✅ Manual testing complete with real video files
- ✅ Performance targets verified
- ✅ Cross-platform testing done
- ✅ Code review self-checklist complete (.cursorrules)
- ✅ No console warnings
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ PR description complete

**USER will then verify:**
- Visual appearance (colors, spacing, fonts, animations)
- Performance feel (smooth, responsive, 30fps video playback)
- Video processing accuracy
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Real video file testing (physical files)

---

## Emergency Procedures

### If blocked:
1. Document blocker in TODO
2. Try different approach
3. Ask for help
4. Don't merge broken code

### If tests fail in CI:
1. Run tests locally first
2. Check CI logs
3. Fix issue
4. Push to same branch
5. Wait for CI to pass

**Remember:** Quality over speed. Better to ship solid feature late than buggy feature on time.
